    "`Information Technology (IT)` refers to the use of computers, software, networks, and other technologies to **store**, **retrieve**, **process**, **transmit** and **present** data and information. The terms `information` and `data` are related but distinct concepts, here's how they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Data:***\n",
    "   - Data refers to raw facts, figures, or symbols that represent information. It is typically unprocessed and lacks context.\n",
    "   - Examples of data include numbers, text, images, and sounds.\n",
    "   - Data by itself does not convey meaning or understanding until it is processed and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Information:***\n",
    "   - Information is processed and organized data that provides context, relevance, and meaning.\n",
    "   - It results from analyzing, interpreting, and structuring data to make it useful for decision-making or understanding.\n",
    "   - Information answers questions like who, what, where, and when, providing insights or answers to specific queries.\n",
    "   - For example, a list of student grades (data) becomes information when organized into a report showing the average grade for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data is raw and unprocessed, information is processed and meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Databases` deal with storage and retrieval of data, while `business logic` of an application processes data, that later on presented by `user interface` (UI). We will have a closer look at typical application architectures with databases later on."

    "   - In the early days of computing, data was typically stored in flat files using file-based systems. (And it is still a viable solution! See *Learn more* section)\n",
    "   - Each application maintained its own set of files (separation and isolation of data), leading to redundancy (additional storage space), data inconsistency (loss of integrity) and incompatible file formats.\n",

    "### 2. Hierarchical and Network Databases (1960s-1970s):\n",
    "   - Hierarchical databases, such as IBM's IMS (Information Management System), organized data in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "   - Network databases, like CODASYL's network model, introduced more flexible relationships between data elements.\n",
    "   - These models offered better organization and retrieval compared to flat files but were complex to implement and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Relational Databases (1970s-Present):\n",
    "   - Relational databases, pioneered by Edgar F. Codd, introduced the relational model based on mathematical set theory.\n",
    "   - Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).\n",
    "   - SQL (Structured Query Language) became the standard language for interacting with relational databases.\n",
    "   - Relational databases, such as Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server, gained widespread adoption due to their simplicity and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Object-Oriented Databases (1980s-2000s):\n",
    "   - Object-oriented databases extended the relational model to include complex data types and inheritance.\n",
    "   - They aimed to bridge the gap between programming languages and databases by directly supporting object-oriented programming concepts.\n",
    "   - Examples include ObjectStore and GemStone, but they faced challenges in scalability and interoperability with relational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. NoSQL Databases (2000s-Present):\n",
    "   - NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases emerged to address the limitations of relational databases in handling large-scale distributed data.\n",
    "   - These databases offer flexible schemas, horizontal scalability, and high availability.\n",
    "   - Types of NoSQL databases include document stores (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. New Paradigms: Graph and Vector-based Databases (2010s-Present):\n",
    "   - Graph databases, such as Neo4j, focus on representing and querying relationships between data entities.\n",
    "   - Vector-based databases, like those used in machine learning and analytics, optimize storage and processing for high-dimensional data.\n",
    "   - These databases cater to specialized use cases, such as recommendation systems, spatial data analysis, and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of databases has been driven by the need for more efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, as well as advancements in computing technologies and data science."

    "## [Roles of Database Management Systems (DBMS)](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Database Management System (DBMS) plays several crucial roles in the management and organization of data within a computer system. Here are the key roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Definition:**\n",
    "   - The DBMS allows users to define the data structure, create tables, and specify the relationships between tables. This role involves defining the schema that represents the organization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Storage Management:**\n",
    "   - DBMS is responsible for efficiently storing and managing the data on physical storage devices. It determines how data is stored, indexed, and retrieved for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - DBMS provides a Query Language (e.g., SQL) to retrieve data from the database. Users can perform queries to extract specific information based on their requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Manipulation:**\n",
    "   - DBMS allows users to insert, update, and delete data in the database. It ensures the integrity of the data by enforcing constraints and rules defined during the data definition phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security and Authorization:**\n",
    "   - DBMS manages access control and ensures that only authorized users have access to specific data. It includes features such as user authentication, encryption, and role-based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concurrency Control:**\n",
    "   - In a multi-user environment, DBMS manages concurrent access to the database to ensure data consistency. It employs techniques like locking and transaction management to handle multiple transactions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Integrity and Constraints:**\n",
    "   - DBMS enforces data integrity by defining constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key) to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Backup and Recovery:**\n",
    "   - DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up the database regularly and recovering data in case of system failures or data corruption. This ensures the availability and durability of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Database Maintenance and Optimization:**\n",
    "   - DBMS includes tools and utilities for database maintenance, such as indexing, query optimization, and performance monitoring, to enhance the overall efficiency of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Data Independence:**\n",
    "    - DBMS provides a level of abstraction between the application programs and the physical storage of data. This enables changes to the database structure without affecting the application programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These roles collectively contribute to the effective and organized management of data within a database system.\n"
