    "Now that you've seen a few very small problems, you might have a very vague idea of how impossibly complicated computer programs can quickly become. In order to build software systems of a meaningful size, we need a mental _framework_ or school of thought that lets us conceptualise _large systems as composites of small units_ with well-defined interactions between them. When thinking about and designing a system in this fashion, we reduce the amount of things we need to hold in our head at one time by mostly only having to consider the properties of one such smaller unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the desire to write software systems with so many interacting little parts that they became impossible to work on came out of _simulation_ in the 60's. In order to overcome this engineering challenge, **Kristen Nygaard** and **Ole-Johan Dahl** developed a mental framework, or _paradigm_, we now call **object-oriented programming**, along with a first implementation in their programming language _Simula I_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Simula_ was highly influential in the language design community and the ideas it introduced inspired the design of the languages that the modern world is built in, such as **C++** and **Java**.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Python_ is not an object-oriented language in that it does not have a particular opinion about how software should be designed. It does however take a few ideas and idioms from object-oriented languages, most notably **classes** and **inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to give a hand-wavy definition of object-oriented softare design, we'll have a look at those features in _Python_ and will try to get a sense of it that way."
